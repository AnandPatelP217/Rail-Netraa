# Rail-Netra (Work Monitoring): A complete solution for Indian Railway Monitoring and Management.

## Overview: 
In this project we used the YOLO v8 algorithm to detect the presence of the Employee on his seat. If the employees are missing from his seats a notfication is sent to the Respective Authority on our Flutter Mobile Application.
Our pretrained YOLO model check the presence  of the person on the chair if the missing persons are more than the thresold_count then a notification is pushed. 

## Technologies used: 
* Flutter and Dart
* YOLO v8
* OpenCV
* Python
* Deep Learning
* Firebase Admin 
* Google Colab
